    <h2>YNAL: You Need A License</h2>
    <p>I made this site because I was tired of having to google "MIT License" all the time. This is a curlable server to add a license to a project. It reads the <code>Accept</code> header and responds with plaintext, HTML, or JSON appropriately. Try it out with:</p>
    <pre>curl -s --output LICENSE.txt https://ynal.packrat386.com/mit</pre>
    <p>This site should not be considered any kind of authority on the validity of these licenses. Do you own research and all that jazz.</p>
